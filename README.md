# Shopify Exporter

Includes helpful classes for use when exporting a Shopify store from SQL
DB or Shopify store -> Shopify store. See the examples directory for
code examples - all that is needed is a config.php file to start (you
can use config.php.dist as a template).

See [examples/all.php](examples/all.php) to export an entire Shopify
store (including articles, pages, collections, customers, and orders).
